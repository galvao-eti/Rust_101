# Annotated Book

This is an annotated version of [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) as in 2025-02-26, with highlighted parts for summarizing it's contents.
This is **NOT** a substitute for the original book. As a matter of fact, I strongly reccommend everyone to read the original in it's entirety.

This work was made by printing the book to PDF in Vivaldi and then using Okular (KDE's native PDF reader) to hightlight and annotate.
