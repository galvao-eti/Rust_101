# Annotated Book

This is an annotated version of [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) as in 2025-02-26, with highlighted parts for summarizing it's contents.
This is **NOT** a substitute for the original book. As a matter of fact, I strongly reccommend everyone to read the original in it's entirety.
